\maketitle

In this document I briefly describe my take on the copyright issues
with my book ``Constructive Recognition of Matrix Groups''.

I think that the book as it stands is a self-contained, state-of-the-art
description of the Matrix Group Recognition Project including quite a
lot of original content first presented in this work. Therefore I would
like to publish it as one piece in essentially its current form.

However, two out of its eight chapters (namely III and VII) were
essentially published in exactly this form as research papers in
the LMS JCM and the J. Algebra respectively with the usual copyright
agreements. Of course, my coauthors have given their consent that I
put our work into this thesis. Also, I am absolutely sure that they
would all agree that I publish this again as one piece. Anyway, the
copyright issues have to be dealt with.

I suggest that we seek to obtain permission form LMS JCM and J. Algebra 
and all coauthors to include the text of the two papers in the monograph.

Obviously, we will acknowledge the coauthorship accordingly in a form
that all people involved are satisfied.
