\chapter{Matrices over finite fields}

This chapter covers the implementation of the basic operations for matrices 
over finite fields. We begin with a description of a new concrete 
representation of such matrices on nowadays computers in 
Section~\ref{sec:ffematrices}, both in main memory and on storage.
We then analyse the complexity of matrix arithmetic for this new
representation in Section~\ref{sec:matarith} and compare it to
previous implementations. In Section~\ref{sec:basalgmat}, we give an
overview over the most basic algorithms for finite field matrices,
before we conclude this chapter with the description of a new method
to compute minimal polynomials of matrices over finite fields in
Section~\ref{sec:minpoly}.
